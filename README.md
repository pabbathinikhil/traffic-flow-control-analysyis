Object Tracking and Counting Using Ultralytics YOLOv8, BoT-SORT, and Supervision
In this project, we utilize Ultralytics YOLOv8 for object detection, BoT-SORT for tracking, and Supervision for counting objects. The primary challenge involves accurately counting objects crossing two separate lanes.

Pipeline Overview
Detection: YOLOv8 identifies objects in each frame.
Tracking: BoT-SORT assigns unique IDs to objects and tracks their movement.
Counting: Supervision monitors objects crossing predefined lane boundaries and counts them separately.
This setup ensures efficient and accurate multi-lane object tracking and counting.
